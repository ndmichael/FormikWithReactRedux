This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What this project is about

This is a student management app that stores information about students including the course taken. 
It saves the data in a react-redux state and then displays the results on the index page.
The form is handled by the Formik library.


# why this project

This project is a practice on all I have learned on formik and react-redux state management.
I decided to put it all together to create this.
